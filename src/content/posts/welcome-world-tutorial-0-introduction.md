title: Build your first Astro Blog 
---

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn Astroâ€™s key features by building a fully\-functioning blog, from zero to full launch! ðŸš€ 



Along the way, youâ€™ll:


* Set up your development environment
* Create pages and blog posts for your website
* Build with Astro components
* Query and work with local files
* Add interactivity to your site
* Deploy your site to the web


Want a preview of what youâ€™re going to build? You can view the final project on [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo) or [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/complete?file=src%2Fpages%2Findex.astro).


Note

If you would rather start exploring Astro with a pre\-built Astro site, you can visit <https://astro.new> and choose a starter template to open and edit in an online editor.
