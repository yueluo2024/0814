title: Data Fetching

`.astro` files can fetch remote data to help you generate your pages.


`fetch()` in Astro
------------------

[Section titled fetch() in Astro](#fetch-in-astro)
All [Astro components](/en/basics/astro-components/) have access to the [global `fetch()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) in their component script to make HTTP requests to APIs using the full URL (e.g. <https://example.com/api>).
Additionally, you can construct a URL to your projectâ€™s pages and endpoints that are rendered on demand on the server using `new URL("/api", Astro.url)`.


This fetch call will be executed at build time, and the data will be available to the component template for generating dynamic HTML. If [SSR](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/) mode is enabled, any fetch calls will be executed at runtime.


ðŸ’¡ Take advantage of [**top\-level await**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await) inside of your Astro component script.


ðŸ’¡ Pass fetched data to both Astro and framework components, as props.




src/components/User.astro


```
---import Contact from '../components/Contact.jsx';import Location from '../components/Location.astro';
const response = await fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/');const data = await response.json();const randomUser = data.results[0];---<!-- Data fetched at build can be rendered in HTML --><h1>User</h1><h2>{randomUser.name.first} {randomUser.name.last}</h2>
<!-- Data fetched at build can be passed to components as props --><Contact client:load email={randomUser.email} /><Location city={randomUser.location.city} />
```

Note

Remember, all data in Astro components is fetched when a component is rendered.

Your deployed Astro site will fetch data **once, at build time**. In dev, you will see data fetches on component refreshes. If you need to re\-fetch data multiple times client\-side, use a [framework component](/en/guides/framework-components/) or a [client\-side script](/en/guides/client-side-scripts/) in an Astro component.


`fetch()` in Framework Components
---------------------------------

[Section titled fetch() in Framework Components](#fetch-in-framework-components)
The `fetch()` function is also globally available to any [framework components](/en/guides/framework-components/):




src/components/Movies.tsx


```
import type { FunctionalComponent } from 'preact';
const data = await fetch('https://example.com/movies.json').then((response) =>  response.json());
// Components that are build-time rendered also log to the CLI.// When rendered with a client:* directive, they also log to the browser console.console.log(data);
const Movies: FunctionalComponent = () => {// Output the result to the page  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;};
export default Movies;
```

GraphQL queries
---------------

[Section titled GraphQL queries](#graphql-queries)
Astro can also use `fetch()` to query a GraphQL server with any valid GraphQL query.




src/components/Film.astro


```
---const response = await fetch("https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index",  {    method: 'POST',    headers: {'Content-Type':'application/json'},    body: JSON.stringify({      query: `        query getFilm ($id:ID!) {          film(id: $id) {            title            releaseDate          }        }      `,      variables: {        id: "ZmlsbXM6MQ==",      },    }),  });
const json = await response.json();const { film } = json.data;---<h1>Fetching information about Star Wars: A New Hope</h1><h2>Title: {film.title}</h2><p>Year: {film.releaseDate}</p>
```

Fetch from a Headless CMS
-------------------------

[Section titled Fetch from a Headless CMS](#fetch-from-a-headless-cms)
Astro components can fetch data from your favorite CMS and then render it as your page content. Using [dynamic routes](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes), components can even generate pages based on your CMS content.


See our [CMS Guides](/en/guides/cms/) for full details on integrating Astro with headless CMSes including Storyblok, Contentful, and WordPress.
