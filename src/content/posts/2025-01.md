**与桃花的年度之约** 

桃花是花卉摄影中最动人的题材之一。
每年的这个时候，我都会扛起相机，往城郊那片桃林走。

晨露还凝在花瓣上时，镜头里的粉白便有了珍珠般的光泽；风过时，整树花枝簌簌摇晃，取景框里的光斑也跟着跳，像把春天的心跳都收进了存储卡。

去年蹲在老桃树下拍蜜蜂采蜜，不小心被枝桠勾住了衣角。起身时带落半捧花瓣，纷纷扬扬落在相机包上，成了那年春天最柔软的意外。

今年特意穿了件浅灰外套，想着让飘落的粉白更显色，却在同样的位置遇见个举着手机的姑娘。她对着花苞对焦的样子，倒和我头一年来这儿时一模一样 —— 原来对春天的心动，从不分器材新旧。

其实桃花的花期短得厉害。前几日还满枝堆雪，一场夜雨就能打落大半。可就是这稍纵即逝的娇嫩，让人总惦记着赴约。

镜头里的花影一年年重叠，树底下的野草换了几茬，唯有按下快门时的心动，和初遇时没什么两样。

—— 原来有些风景，真的能让人在重复的时光里，反复爱上春天。


>Supported page files
--------------------

[Section titled Supported page files](#supported-page-files)
Astro supports the following file types in the `src/pages/` directory:


* [`花瓣`](#花瓣)
* [`晨露`](#晨露)
* `.mdx` (with the [MDX Integration installed](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#installation))
* [`.html`](#html-pages)
* `.js`/`.ts` (as [endpoints](/en/guides/endpoints/))


File\-based routing
-------------------

[Section titled File\-based routing](#file-based-routing)
Astro leverages a routing strategy called **file\-based routing**. Each file in your `src/pages/` directory becomes an endpoint on your site based on its file path.


A single file can also generate multiple pages using [dynamic routing](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes). This allows you to create pages even if your content lives outside of the special `/pages/` directory, such as in a [content collection](/en/guides/content-collections/) or a [CMS](/en/guides/cms/).




Read more about [Routing in Astro](/en/guides/routing/).

### Link between pages

[Section titled Link between pages](#link-between-pages)
Write standard HTML [`<a>` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) in your Astro pages to link to other pages on your site. Use a **URL path relative to your root domain** as your link, not a relative file path.


For example, to link to `https://example.com/authors/sonali/` from any other page on `example.com`:




src/pages/index.astro


```
Read more <a href="/authors/sonali/">about Sonali</a>.
```

Astro Pages
-----------

[Section titled Astro Pages](#astro-pages)
Astro pages use the `.astro` file extension and support the same features as [Astro components](/en/basics/astro-components/).




src/pages/index.astro


```
------<html lang="en">  <head>    <title>My Homepage</title>  </head>  <body>    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>  </body></html>
```

A page must produce a full HTML document. If not explicitly included, Astro will add the necessary `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and `<head>` content to any `.astro` component located within `src/pages/` by default. You can opt\-out of this behavior on a per\-component basis by marking it as a [partial](#page-partials) page.


To avoid repeating the same HTML elements on every page, you can move common `<head>` and `<body>` elements into your own [layout components](/en/basics/layouts/). You can use as many or as few layout components as you’d like.




src/pages/index.astro


```
---import MySiteLayout from '../layouts/MySiteLayout.astro';---<MySiteLayout>  <p>My page content, wrapped in a layout!</p></MySiteLayout>
```



Read more about [layout components](/en/basics/layouts/) in Astro.

Markdown/MDX Pages
------------------

[Section titled Markdown/MDX Pages](#markdownmdx-pages)
Astro also treats any Markdown (`.md`) files inside of `src/pages/` as pages in your final website. If you have the [MDX Integration installed](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#installation), it also treats MDX (`.mdx`) files the same way.


Tip

Consider creating [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) instead of pages for directories of related Markdown files that share a similar structure, such as blog posts or product items.


Markdown files can use the special `layout` frontmatter property to specify a [layout component](/en/basics/layouts/) that will wrap their Markdown content in a full `<html>...</html>` page document.




src/pages/page.md


```
---layout: '../layouts/MySiteLayout.astro'title: 'My Markdown page'---# Title
This is my page, written in **Markdown.**
```



Read more about [Markdown](/en/guides/markdown-content/) in Astro.

HTML Pages
----------

[Section titled HTML Pages](#html-pages)
Files with the `.html` file extension can be placed in the `src/pages/` directory and used directly as pages on your site. Note that some key Astro features are not supported in [HTML Components](/en/basics/astro-components/#html-components).


Custom 404 Error Page
---------------------

[Section titled Custom 404 Error Page](#custom-404-error-page)
For a custom 404 error page, you can create a `404.astro` or `404.md` file in `src/pages`.


This will build to a `404.html` page. Most [deploy services](/en/guides/deploy/) will find and use it.


Custom 500 Error Page
---------------------

[Section titled Custom 500 Error Page](#custom-500-error-page)
For a custom 500 error page to show for pages that are [rendered on demand](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#enable-on-demand-server-rendering), create the file `src/pages/500.astro`. This custom page is not available for prerendered pages and can’t be prerendered.


If an error occurs rendering this page, your host’s default 500 error page will be shown to your visitor.



**Added in:**
`astro@4.10.3`



During development, if you have a `500.astro`, the error thrown at runtime is logged in your terminal, as opposed to being shown in the error overlay.


### `error`

[Section titled error](#error)

**Added in:**
`astro@4.11.0`



`src/pages/500.astro` is a special page that is automatically passed an `error` prop for any error thrown during rendering. This allows you to use the details of an error (e.g. from a page, from middleware, etc.) to display information to your visitor.


The error prop’s data type can be anything, which may affect how you type or use the value in your code:




src/pages/500\.astro


```
---interface Props {    error: unknown}
const { error } = Astro.props---
<div>{error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'}</div>
```

To avoid leaking sensitive information when displaying content from the `error` prop, consider evaluating the error first, and returning appropriate content based on the error thrown. For example, you should avoid displaying the error’s stack as it contains information about how your code is structured on the server


Page Partials
-------------

[Section titled Page Partials](#page-partials)

**Added in:**
`astro@3.4.0`



Caution

Page partials are intended to be used in conjunction with a front\-end library, such as [htmx](https://htmx.org/) or [Unpoly](https://unpoly.com/). You can also use them if you are comfortable writing low\-level front\-end JavaScript. For this reason they are an advanced feature.

Additionally, partials should not be used if the component contains scoped styles or scripts, as these elements will be stripped from the HTML output. If you need scoped styles, it is better to use regular, non\-partial pages along with a frontend library that knows how to merge the contents into the head.


Partials are page components located within `src/pages/` that are not intended to render as full pages.


Like components located outside of this folder, these files do not automatically include the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, nor any `<head>` content such as scoped styles and scripts.


However, because they are located in the special `src/pages/` directory, the generated HTML is available at a URL corresponding to its file path. This allows a rendering library (e.g. htmx, Stimulus, jQuery) to access it on the client and load sections of HTML dynamically on a page without a browser refresh or page navigation.


Partials, when combined with a rendering library, provide an alternative to [Astro islands](/en/concepts/islands/) and [`<script>` tags](/en/guides/client-side-scripts/) for building dynamic content in Astro.


Page files that can export a value (e.g. `.astro` , `.mdx`) can be marked as partials.


Configure a file within the `src/pages/` directory to be a partial by adding the following export:




src/pages/partial.astro


```
---export const partial = true;---
<li>I'm a partial!</li>
```

The `export const partial` must be identifiable statically. It can have the value of:


* The boolean **`true`**.
* An environment variable using import.meta.env such as `import.meta.env.USE_PARTIALS`.


### Using with a library

[Section titled Using with a library](#using-with-a-library)
Partials are used to dynamically update a section of a page using a library such as [htmx](https://htmx.org/).


The following example shows an `hx-post` attribute set to a partial’s URL. The content from the partial page will be used to update the targeted HTML element on this page.




src/pages/index.astro


```
<html>  <head>    <title>My page</title>    <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.6"      integrity="sha384-FhXw7b6AlE/jyjlZH5iHa/tTe9EpJ1Y55RjcgPbjeWMskSxZt1v9qkxLJWNJaGni"      crossorigin="anonymous"></script>  </head></html><section>  <div id="parent-div">Target here</div>
  <button hx-post="/partials/clicked/"    hx-trigger="click"    hx-target="#parent-div"    hx-swap="innerHTML"  >      Click Me!  </button></section>
```

The `.astro` partial must exist at the corresponding file path, and include an export defining the page as a partial:




src/pages/partials/clicked.astro


```
---export const partial = true;---<div>I was clicked!</div>
```

See the [htmx documentation](https://htmx.org/docs/) for more details on using htmx.
